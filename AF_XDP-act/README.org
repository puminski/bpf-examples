#+Title: Asynchronious Cyclic Transmission (ACT)  sample application

This is a sample application for ACT Library. It is based on
AF_XDP sockets example application.

Example
Following example transmits 50 cycles ("-n 50"), each of them with 10 packets ("-C 10"),
using  ens21f0np0 interface (-i ens21f0np0).
On my machine it should run with root priviledge ("sudo")

  sudo ./xdpact -i ens21f0np0 -C 10 -n 50
#+END_SRC
